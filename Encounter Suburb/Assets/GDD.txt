Encounter Suburb (Battle City)

Done:
    If tanks collides with breakable, set it as target and don't move until it is broken.
    Water tiles do not block enemies, since pathfinding directs them away anyway.
    Map loading from image file.
    Bigger resolution to pathfinding grid, and smoothing. This works because we destroy any breakable in our way.
    PathFinding weights so that tanks would avoid sticking to walls
    Move camera to properly view different sized maps
    named levels
    
    Levels:
        Map from texture, where n is min (width, height), nxn square with encoded tile types. Pixels on x axis after n
        describe waves, so that r is huntercount, g is pummelcount and b is heavycount 

    quit on exit from main menu

    Enemy tank types:
            Hunter - Always goes for player : fast light gun
            Pummel - Always goes for base :  slow short-ranged powerful gun
            Heavy - Bigger better overall tnak
       
    enemy spawn effect
 
    Player hitpoints in hud
    Base hitpoint in hud
    Properify Layer Usage(collisions)

    Procedural colour tweaking:
        Randomize tank wave type order, using level name as seed
        Randomly slightly vary trees', obstacles' and tanks' colors
        
    
    Build map ground texture from multiple textures
    
    Actual enemy spawnings and spawn points are generated from available pools

    VFX
    
    Colliders on edges
    
    pummels rotate to target breakable, pummel behaviour broken altogether
    targetbreakable can be another tank, fix
    
    Enemies shoot bursts
    
    New waves to spawn when last is killed
    Tanks rotate to base on spawn
    
    Pause game

Next up:
    
    Controls screen in menu
    Pause menu, go to main menu or controls
    
    Hunters go for player, but will go for base if player unreachable
    pummels go for base, but will engage player if close enough
    stop at distance
    use explicit targets, similar to target breakables
    Enemies don't destroy walls anymore

    build map in thread during level countdown, even in compute shader
    
    Disable Enemy Friendly Fire

    Enemies check real line of sight with raycast
        Use raycast to cast from enemy to player
        use this when deciding to shoot and also when checking if player is in range
