Encounter Suburb (Battle City)

Constant grid size, fits tank = 5 units
Movement is still free

Done:
    If tanks collides with breakable, set it as target and don't move until it is broken.
    Water tiles do not block enemies, since pathfinding directs them away anyway.
    Map loading from image file.

Next up:
    PathFinding to non-singleton
    PathFinding weights so that tanks would avoid sticking to walls
    
    Smooth water colliders.
    Make collision detection better, maybe using longer rays.
   
   Enemy tank types:
        Hunter - Always goes for player : fast light gun
        Pummel - Always goes for base :  slow short-ranged powerful gun
        Grunt - Moves to base but also engages player : medium gun
        Heavy - Bigger version of grunt : Fast powerful gun 
    
    Bigger resolution to pathfinding grid, and smoothing. This works because we destroy any breakable in our way.
    Make buffer check so that tank can stop even before it collides with breakable.
