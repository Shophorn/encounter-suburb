Encounter Suburb (Battle City)

Constant grid size, fits tank = 5 units
Movement is still free

Done:
    If tanks collides with breakable, set it as target and don't move until it is broken.
    Water tiles do not block enemies, since pathfinding directs them away anyway.
    Map loading from image file.
    Bigger resolution to pathfinding grid, and smoothing. This works because we destroy any breakable in our way.
    PathFinding weights so that tanks would avoid sticking to walls
    Move camera to properly view different sized maps
    named levels
    
    Levels:
        Map from texture, where n is min (width, height), nxn square with encoded tile types. Pixels on x axis after n
        describe waves, so that r is huntercount, g is pummelcount and b is heavycount 

Next up:
    Make collision detection better, maybe using longer rays.
    Make buffer check so that tank can stop even before it collides with breakable.
    Enemies check real line of sight with raycast
        Use raycast to cast from enemy to player
    Disable Enemy Friendly Fire
    
    Smooth water colliders -> Marching squares
   
    Clean Gun/Tank/Projectile/Turret hierarchy
    Enemy tank types:
        Hunter - Always goes for player : fast light gun
        Pummel - Always goes for base :  slow short-ranged powerful gun
        Grunt - Moves to base but also engages player : medium gun
        Heavy - Bigger version of grunt : Fast powerful gun

    Properify Layer Usage(collisions)
    
    BoxColliders' height should be enough(lot) so that heights don't matter
